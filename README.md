# SafeNav: Enhancing Travel Safety

SafeNav is an innovative safety solution for the residents of Karachi, offering a state-of-the-art mobile application to identify crime hotspots within the city. By analyzing historical crime data, SafeNav provides timely and actionable insights, enabling users to navigate safely. The application's attractive and user-friendly interface delivers a clear picture of crime-prone areas, ensuring peace of mind for its users.

## Motivation
With urbanization and travel increasing day by day, the need for safety-enhancing tools grows. Despite its widespread use, Google Maps lacks critical safety features, leaving users exposed to potential risks. SafeNav bridges this gap by integrating safety alerts for high-risk areas within Karachi, empowering users to make informed decisions about their routes.

   - Collect and merge real-time data from multiple sources, including:
     - Online Newspapers
     - Facebook Pages
     - YouTube Videos
     - Google Forms

### 2. **Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model Development**
   - Pre-process and analyze the integrated data for better efficiency.
   - Develop machine learning algorithms to examine and process the merged data.

### 3. **Model Deployment**
   - Deploy the machine learning model using Flask and Render Server.
   - Integrate the model with the Flutter mobile application.

### 4. **App Development**
   - Build a user-friendly and interactive platform using the Flutter Framework.
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility and seamless deployment.
   - Use PostgreSQL as the server database.
   - Include a user feedback feature for incident reporting.

### 5. **Admin Dashboard Development**
   - Develop an intuitive SafeNav admin dashboard to visualize crime data.
   - Incorporate backend development and implement clear objectives for crime data management.
